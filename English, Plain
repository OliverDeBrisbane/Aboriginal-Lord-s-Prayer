God, our father, you live in heaven.
We want everyone to respect you.
We want you to be everyone’s boss.
We want everyone in the world to do what you want,
just like everyone in heaven does what you want.
Please give us the food that we need each day. 
Please don’t punish us for the bad things that we did,
just like we don’t do payback to the people that did bad things to us.
Don’t let anything push us to do bad things.
And keep us safe from the devil, the boss over the bad spirits.
Amen.
